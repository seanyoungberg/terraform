## 4 x VM-Series / 2 x Spoke VPCs via Advanced Peering and Load Balancer as Next Hop
Terraform creates 4 VM-Series firewalls that secure ingress/egress/east-west traffic for 2 spoke VPCs.  The spoke VPCs are connected (via VPC Peering and Load Balancer as Next Hop) to the VM-Series. After the build completes, several manual changes must be performed to enable transitive routing.  The manual changes are required since they cannot be performed through Terraform, yet.

### Overview
* 8 x VPCs (ilb-mgmt,ilb-untust,ilb-trust,mgmt, untrust, trust, spoke1, & spoke2) with relevant peering connections
* 4 x VM-Series (BYOL / Bundle1 / Bundle2)
* 2 x Ubuntu VM in spoke1 VPC (install Apache during creation)
* 1 x Ubuntu VM in spoke2 VPC
* 1 x GCP Public Load Balancer (VM-Series as backend)
* 1 x GCP Internal Load Balancer (spoke1 VM's as backend)
* 1 x GCP Internal Load Balancer (VM-Series firewall 3 & 4 as backend)
* 2 x GCP Storage Bucket for VM-Series bootstrapping (random string appended to bucket name for global uniqueness)

### Prerequistes 
1. Terraform
2. Access to GCP Console

After deployment, the firewalls' username and password are:
     * **Username:** paloalto
     * **Password:** Pal0Alt0@123

### Deployment
1.  Download the **adv-peering-with-lbnh** repo to the machine running the build
2.  In an editor, open **variables.tf** and set values for the following variables

| Variable        | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| `main_project` | Project ID for the VM-Series, VM-Series VPCs, GCP storage bucket, & public load balancer. |
| `main_project_auth_file` | Authentication key file for main_project |
| `spoke1_project` | Project ID for spoke1 VMs, VPC, & internal load balancer |
| `spoke1_project_auth_file`| Authentication key file for spoke1_project |
| `spoke2_project` | Project ID for spoke2 VM & VPC |
| `spoke2_project_auth_file` | Authentication key file for spoke2_project |
| `ubuntu_ssh_key` | Public key used to authenticate to Ubuntu VMs (**user must be ubuntu**) |
| `vmseries_image` | Uncomment the VM-Series license you want to deploy |

3.  Download project authenication key files to the main directory of the terraform build.

</p>

4. Execute Terraform
```
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

5. After deployment finishes, for EACH PEER, enable **Import custom routes** & **Export custom routes**

</p>

6. Remove default GCP VPC route for spoke1-vpc, spoke2-vpc, & trust-vpc

</p>

7. From Terraform output, go to `GLB-ADDRESSÂ = http://<glb_eip>` in a web browser.  NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES FOR SPOKE1 VMs TO FULLY INSTALL APACHE & PHP SETUP.
